# Challenge3-generatePass

Welcome to Project generatePass Here you will be able to generate a randomized secure password whether for personal use or for a business purposes. These days it is getting harder and harder to keep a password secure from those of who intend on cracking your devices and services. This generate is meant to resolve this. 

## Key Feautures 

With this generator you may be able to choose to include or exclude any of these paremeters as long as 2 have been chosen. This is to better secure your account.

- Choose to have a total of **8 to 128 characters**
- Choose if you would like **Special Characters**
- Choose if you would like **Lowercase Characters**
- Choose if you would like **Uppercase Characters**
- Choose if you would like **Numbers**

## Get Started

To get started simply go to the website [here](https://j-sniff.github.io/Challenge3-generatePass/) and press the generate button. Once the generate button has been pressed a series of prompts will start. This is where you will choose to have which perameters you would like to include. Once finished with the prompts your newly custom password will generate.



I hope you take of advantage of this tool and helps you to stay more secure. I recommend changing your password atleast once a month to avoid a breach.
