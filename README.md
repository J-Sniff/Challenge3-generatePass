# Challenge3-generatePass

Welcome to Project generatePass Here you will be able to generate a randomized secure password whether for personal use or for a business purposes. These days it is getting harder and harder to keep a password secure from those of who intend on cracking your devices and services. This generate is meant to resolve this. 

## Key Feautures 

With this generator you may be able to choose to include or exclude any of these paremeters as long as 2 have been chosen. This is to better secure your account.

Once the generate button has been pressed a series of prompts will start. This is where you will choose to have which perameters you would like to include. Once finished with the prompts your newly custom password will generate.
